what the issue was, where it was, and if it has a proper name identified by a static analyzer

Course class

- constructor and reassign methods did not handle null String values or negative int values
- constructor initialized enrolledStudentCount to 500 instead of 0
- enrollStudent() did not check capacity
- enrollStudent() always returned false
- isCourseFull() check was incorrect
- setEnrolledStudentCount() did not check capacity for value above enrollmentCapacity
- setEnrolledStudentCount() did not check for negative values
- dropStudent() always returned false
- dropStudent() did not check if at least one student is enrolled
- getCourseLocation() returned instructorName
- getInstructorName() returned courseLocation
- no getter method for enrolledStudentCount

Department class

- constructor did not handle null String values or negative int values
- getNumberOfMajors() returned an incorrect value due to -ve sign
- getDepartmentChair() returned string "this.departmentChair" rather than actual value
- addPersonToMajor() did not account for INTEGER.MAX_VALUE
- dropPersonFromMajor did not check existing count is above zero
- addCourse() does not account for null parameters
- addCourse() comments do not specify how duplicate courseId should be handled
- toString() does not return StringBuilder result correctly

MyFileDatabase class

- departmentMapping not initialized when flag is not 0, it caused deSerializeObjectFromFile to throw exception
- setMapping did not handle null, it caused toString error
